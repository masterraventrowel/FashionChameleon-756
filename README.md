## ✨ Highlight
> **1. Interactive Customization.** We train a single-garment switching teacher using tailored I2V priors and mismatched reference–garment pairs. During generation, we introduce KV-cache rescheduling to enable interactive multi-garment customization without requiring video data containing multi-garment switching.

> **2. Gradient-Reweighted DMD.** Traditional self-forcing treats all self-rolled frames equally during DMD backpropagation. However, later frames typically suffer from larger quality degradation and thus require stronger gradient supervision. We dynamically reweight DMD gradients during self-rolling using a reward model to improve extrapolation consistency.

> **3. Real-Time Generation.** Through streaming distillation with in-context learning, FashionChameleon achieves 23.8 FPS for 720p generation on a single H200 GPU, 30–180× faster than existing customization methods.

## 🔧 Step0. Setup
### Prepare Environment
```
git clone https://github.com/masterraventrowel/FashionChameleon-756
cd FashionChameleon


## 🚀 Step1. In-Context SFT  
### Start Training
You can run the following command to start sft:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=1234 trainer/train.py \
    --config_path configs/sft_wan22_ic.yaml \
    --save_dir outputs/sft_wan22_ic
```
or simply run:
```bash
bash scripts/train/sft_wan22_ic.sh
```
All training configurations are recorded in `configs/sft_wan22_ic.yaml`, which can be freely modified according to your needs.
Note that our training framework supports **variable-resolution bucketing strategies**, **gradient accumulation**, and **mixed captions**; you only need to adjust the corresponding `ASPECT_RATIO`, `grad_accum_steps`, and `mixed_captions` parameters accordingly.
Our FashionChameleon keeps a fixed training resolution of 1280 × 704 while simultaneously maintaining mixed captions during the in-context sft process, with a global batch size of 64.

### Start Inference
You can run the following command to start bidirectional inference:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python predictor/infer_ic.py \
    --config_path configs/sft_wan22_ic.yaml \
    --seed 42 \
    --h 1280 \
    --w 704 \
    --num_frames 81 \
    --output_path samples/sft_wan22_ic/ \
    --checkpoint XXX
```
or simple run:
```bash
bash scripts/infer/infer_wan22_ic.sh
```
The `checkpoint` denotes the weights after in-context sft.
Our inference code by default processes data in the format of HGC-Bench. You can first download the test dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/QuanjianSong/HGC-Bench).


## 🧑‍🏫 Step2. In-Context Teacher Forcing
### Start Training
You can run the following command to start in-context teacher forcing:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=1234 trainer/train.py \
    --config_path configs/tf_wan22_ic.yaml \
    --save_dir outputs/tf_wan22_ic
```
or simple run:
```bash
bash scripts/train/tf_wan22_ic.sh
```
All training configurations are recorded in `configs/tf_wan22_ic.yaml`, which can be freely modified according to your needs.
Note that our training framework supports **variable-resolution bucketing strategies**, **gradient accumulation**, and **mixed captions**; you only need to adjust the corresponding `ASPECT_RATIO`, `grad_accum_steps`, and `mixed_captions` parameters accordingly.
Our FashionChameleon keeps a fixed training resolution of 1280 × 704 while simultaneously maintaining long caption during the in-context teacher forcing, with a global batch size of 64.

### Start Inference
You can run the following command to start causal inference:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python predictor/causal_infer_ic.py \
    --config_path configs/tf_wan22_ic.yaml \
    --seed 42 \
    --h 1280 \
    --w 704 \
    --num_frames 81 \
    --output_path samples/tf_wan22_ic/ \
    --checkpoint XXX
```
or simple run:
```bash
bash scripts/infer/causal_infer_wan22_ic.sh
```
The `checkpoint` denotes the weights after in-context teacher forcing.
Our inference code by default processes data in the format of HGC-Bench. You can first download the test dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/QuanjianSong/HGC-Bench).


## 📈 Step3. Gradient-Reweighted DMD
### Start Training
You can run the following command to start gradient-reweighted dmd with self-forcing:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=1234 trainer/train.py \
    --config_path configs/gr_dmd_wan22_ic.yaml \
    --save_dir outputs/gr_dmd_wan22_ic
```
or simple run:
```bash
bash scripts/train/sf_wan22_ic.sh
```
All training configurations are recorded in `configs/gr_dmd_wan22_ic.yaml`, which can be freely modified according to your needs.
Note that our training framework supports **variable-resolution bucketing strategies**, **gradient accumulation**, and **mixed captions**; you only need to adjust the corresponding `ASPECT_RATIO`, `grad_accum_steps`, and `mixed_captions` parameters accordingly.
Our FashionChameleon keeps a fixed training resolution of 1280 × 704 while simultaneously maintaining long caption during the in-context gradient-reweighted dmd, with a global batch size of 64..
### Start Inference
You can run the following command to start stream inference:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python predictor/stream_infer_ic.py \
    --config_path configs/gr_dmd_wan22_ic.yaml \
    --seed 42 \
    --h 1280 \
    --w 704 \
    --num_frames 81 \
    --output_path samples/gr_dmd_wan22_ic_reward/ \
    --checkpoint XXX
```
or simple run:
```bash
bash scripts/infer/stream_infer_wan22_ic.sh
```
The `checkpoint` denotes the weights after gradient-reweighted dmd with self-forcing.
Our inference code by default processes data in the format of HGC-Bench. You can first download the test dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/QuanjianSong/HGC-Bench).
